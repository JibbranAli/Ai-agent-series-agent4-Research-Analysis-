## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Web Research
The agent searches for information from trusted sources like Reuters, Bloomberg, and academic journals.

```python
from web_search import WebSearch

search = WebSearch()
results = search.find_info("Tesla market share")
print(f"Found {len(results)} sources")
```

### Step 2: Market Analysis
Analyze companies and their competitors.

```python
from market_analyzer import MarketAnalyzer

analyzer = MarketAnalyzer()
tesla_analysis = analyzer.analyze_company("Tesla")
print(f"Tesla's strengths: {tesla_analysis['strengths']}")
```

### Step 3: Trend Tracking
Identify and track market trends.

```python
from trend_tracker import TrendTracker

tracker = TrendTracker()
trends = tracker.find_trends("Electric Vehicles")
print(f"Found {len(trends)} trends")
```

### Step 4: Generate Reports
Create professional reports.

```python
from report_generator import ReportGenerator

generator = ReportGenerator()
report = generator.create_report("Tesla Analysis", data)
generator.save_as_pdf(report, "tesla_report.pdf")
```

## 📊 Real Examples

### Example 1: Analyze Tesla's Market Position
```python
from research_agent import ResearchAgent

agent = ResearchAgent()

# Get Tesla information
tesla_info = agent.search_company("Tesla")

# Analyze competitors
competitors = agent.find_competitors("Tesla", "Electric Vehicles")

# Generate report
report = agent.create_report("Tesla Market Analysis", {
    'company': tesla_info,
    'competitors': competitors
})

print("Report created successfully!")
```

### Example 2: Track AI Trends
```python
from trend_tracker import TrendTracker

tracker = TrendTracker()

# Find AI trends
ai_trends = tracker.find_trends("Artificial Intelligence")

# Predict future
prediction = tracker.predict_future("AI", months=12)

print(f"AI trends: {len(ai_trends)}")
print(f"Prediction confidence: {prediction['confidence']}")
```

### Example 3: Market Opportunity Analysis
```python
from market_analyzer import MarketAnalyzer

analyzer = MarketAnalyzer()

# Analyze fintech market in India
opportunities = analyzer.find_opportunities("Fintech", "India")

print(f"Market size: ${opportunities['market_size']:,}")
print(f"Growth rate: {opportunities['growth_rate']}%")
```
